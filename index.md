# Projects

## Topic Modeling Exploration

I created a streamlit app to help explore different methods involved in topic modeling in natural language processing as I learn about different techniques. I hope to continue updating this app as I learn more.

## Short-Term Rental Applications in New Orleans

I wanted to try out using Dash so I created a small app to visualize data about short-term rental applications in New Orleans. I want to continue working on it as I play around with Plotly and app callbacks.

# Analysis

## Classification of Good and Bad Customers for a Bank

Is it possible to create a classification model that will predict whether someone will be a "good" or "bad" customer? I try to do so in this analysis and weigh the choices between high sensitivity and low specificity and vice versa.

## Classifying Movies and TV Shows Based on their Descriptions

Can we determine if we are reading a description for a movie or a TV show? I attempt to find out as I use natural language processing techniques to utilize text data in a classification model.

## NFL Suspensions Analysis

A write-up of my analysis of the relationship between the number of suspensions for an NFL team versus the team's winning prediction.
